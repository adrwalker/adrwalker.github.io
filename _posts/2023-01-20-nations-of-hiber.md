Hibernation season approaches once again.

But the forest is closing in, shrunken each year by foreign invaders. Desperate times have brought an unlikely alliance: the Bear Nation and the Bee Nation are working together!

Protect the forest and defeat the humans so that all have a place to hibernate!
